# OroMagentoCalendarCRMBridgeBundle

OroMagentoCalendarCRMBridgeBundle is a bridge that integrates features of the [OroCalendarBundle](https://github.com/oroinc/OroCalendarBundle) into OroCRM applications that have the connector to Magento 1.

The bundle enables the Calendar Events [activity](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ActivityBundle) for the Magento Customer and Magento Order entities, and allows for creation of Calendar Events from the pages of these entities with the appropriate prefilled event context.
